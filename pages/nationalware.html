                <summary> Chief Adviser Professor Dr Muhammad Yunus today said his interim government will rehabilitate families of all mass-uprising martyrs and bear full expanses of the treatment of all injured.</summary>

                "I have said it earlier, and again I am informing that the families of all the martyrs of the mass uprising will be rehabilitated and none will be left out," he said in a televised address to the nation on the completion of 100 days of the interim government.
                
                He said each martyr's family will get Taka 30 lakh from the government while the health ministry has prepared a comprehensive list for the long-term and costly treatment of the injured and looking after the families of the martyrs. 
                
                Prof Yunus said the government took steps to bring corneas from Nepal for the treatment of those who lost their eyesight suffering pellet injury in the mass uprising. 
                
                The Chief Adviser said some deserving injured have also been sent abroad for better treatment under government initiatives. 
                
                No martyrs and injured students and workers of the July uprising will be left out of rehabilitation plan and healthcare, he asserted. 
                
                "This is the commitment of the interim government," he added.
                
                Prof Yunus said the July Shaheed Smriti Foundation, formed to preserve the memory of the martyrs of this mass uprising, has started their works in a strong manner. The government has given a grant of Taka 100 crores to this foundation, he mentioned.
            
                He said the social welfare ministry has sent a $ 5 million allocation proposal to the World Bank through the Economic Relations Division to ensure the rehabilitation of the families of the martyrs and the best treatment of the injured in the July-August revolution.

                  <summary>President of the Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DCCI) Ashraf Ahmed has said that there is a growing trend among middle-income households in Bangladesh to seek healthcare services abroad, despite the availability of many treatments locally.</summary>

                  “While many of the treatments are available locally, the demand for medical tourism keeps growing unabated,” he said during a seminar titled “Reversing the Outbound Healthcare Tourism” organised by DCCI at its auditorium on Saturday.
                  Ashraf Ahmed cited data from the World Trade Organization (WTO), saying that 49 percent of Bangladeshis lack access to quality healthcare, which has fuelled a rising tendency to seek treatment overseas.

                  He said that the trend is not driven by cost considerations, as travel and living expenses often make foreign treatments marginally more expensive. “Instead, it stems from issues such as a lack of international standards in local healthcare and insufficient customer satisfaction.”

                  He went on to say, “Except for a few treatments like robotic surgery, the key drivers of this trend are the relatively lower confidence in and satisfaction with local services.”
