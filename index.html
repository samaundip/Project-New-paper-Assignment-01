                       <summary> Chief Adviser Professor Dr Muhammad Yunus today said his interim government will rehabilitate families of all mass-uprising martyrs and bear full expanses of the treatment of all injured.</summary>

                     "I have said it earlier, and again I am informing that the families of all the martyrs of the mass uprising will be rehabilitated and none will be left out," he said in a televised address to the nation on the completion of 100 days of the interim government.
                    
                     He said each martyr's family will get Taka 30 lakh from the government while the health ministry has prepared a comprehensive list for the long-term and costly treatment of the injured and looking after the families of the martyrs. 
                    
                     Prof Yunus said the government took steps to bring corneas from Nepal for the treatment of those who lost their eyesight suffering pellet injury in the mass uprising. 
                    
                     The Chief Adviser said some deserving injured have also been sent abroad for better treatment under  government initiatives. 
                    
                     No martyrs and injured students and workers of the July uprising will be left out of rehabilitation plan and healthcare, he asserted. 
                    
                     "This is the commitment of the interim government," he added.
                    
                     Prof Yunus said the July Shaheed Smriti Foundation, formed to preserve the memory of the martyrs of this mass uprising, has started their works in a strong manner. The government has given a grant of Taka 100 crores to this foundation, he mentioned.
                
                     He said the social welfare ministry has sent a $ 5 million allocation proposal to the World Bank through the Economic Relations Division to ensure the rehabilitation of the families of the martyrs and the best treatment of the injured in the July-August revolution.

                      <summary>President of the Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DCCI) Ashraf Ahmed has said that there is a growing trend among middle-income households in Bangladesh to seek healthcare services abroad, despite the availability of many treatments locally.</summary>

                      “While many of the treatments are available locally, the demand for medical tourism keeps growing unabated,” he said during a seminar titled “Reversing the Outbound Healthcare Tourism” organised by DCCI at its auditorium on Saturday.
                      Ashraf Ahmed cited data from the World Trade Organization (WTO), saying that 49 percent of Bangladeshis lack access to quality healthcare, which has fuelled a rising tendency to seek treatment overseas.

                      He said that the trend is not driven by cost considerations, as travel and living expenses often make foreign treatments marginally more expensive. “Instead, it stems from issues such as a lack of international standards in local healthcare and insufficient customer satisfaction.”

                      He went on to say, “Except for a few treatments like robotic surgery, the key drivers of this trend are the relatively lower confidence in and satisfaction with local services.”

                    The team has held discussions with the workers' organisation Solidarity Center about the working environment of labourers, among other issues.
                    
                    The delegation was led by Kelly M Fay Rodríguez, special representative for International Labour Affairs from the US Department of State, and Thea Lee, deputy undersecretary from the Department of Labour.
                    China ambassador to Bangladesh Yao Wen emphasized that regardless of changes in domestic or regional circumstances, the China-Bangladesh relationship has remained steadfast, progressing steadily in the right direction.

                    This stable partnership has become a pillar of regional peace and prosperity, he added.

                    The envoy highlighted that cultural exchange is a vital bridge connecting the hearts of the two peoples, with China-Bangladesh friendship deeply rooted in the community and benefiting both nations.

                        UNICEF has appointed Gargee Tanushree Paul as a new youth advocate in Bangladesh for the coming two years.

                        During the signing ceremony for her new role, Gargee met with Rana Flowers, UNICEF Representative in Bangladesh, and discussed children's rights in the country, said a press release received on Thursday.  
                     </summary>
                        In her new role as a youth advocate, Gargee will engage with UNICEF in global and national moments to amplify children’s voices and advocate for children’s rights including increasing awareness of climate action, protecting their future from violence, neglect, abuse and childhood traumas, child marriage, learning crisis and prioritising the most vulnerable and marginalised children in all areas of development.

                       Gargee, now 16-year-old, is a dedicated child rights advocate and journalist, currently a student in Grade 10 at Scholastica School, said the release.
                    
                     She engages in supporting underprivileged children, as well as on projects to improve education for indigenous children.
                    
                     Gargee has published over 200 reports with child journalism.

                   Lamine Yamal, 16, became the tournament's youngest ever goalscorer as Spain came back to beat   France 2-1 in Munich on Tuesday and reach the Euro 2024 final.</summary>

                  Trailing after Randal Kolo Muani headed in a Kylian Mbappe cross in the ninth minute, Spain turned the match around in a four-minute period, scoring twice against a side who had only conceded once in five previous games in this tournament.
             
                  Yamal, who turns 17 a day before Sunday's final against either the Netherlands or England, equalised with a superb strike from outside the box, curling a long-range effort into the top corner and past the fingertips of an airborne Mike Maignan.
             
                  Spain took the lead on 25 minutes, Dani Olmo expertly gathering a loose ball and firing a low shot into the net with the aid of a deflection off Jules Kounde.
             
                   "I got the ball, didn't think about it for too long and just shot," Yamal said of his brilliant strike. "I'm just enjoying myself and I'm proud to be in the final."
             
                   Three-time champions Spain became the first team to win six games at a Euros and are one game away from a record-breaking fourth crown.
             
                  "We are one step away from glory," Olmo told ZDF. "We are very, very close. This team is unbelievable. We deserve it."
             
                  This weekend in Berlin will be Spain's first appearance in a major tournament final since a much-vaunted side thrashed Italy 4-0 in the Euro 2012 showpiece.
